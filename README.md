# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a simple stock price prediction model using **Linear Regression** in Python.  
Historical stock data is used to predict the **next day’s price** based on the previous day’s **High price**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to:
- Load historical stock data from a CSV file
- Clean and preprocess financial data
- Train a machine learning model
- Predict future stock prices
- Evaluate the model using RMSE
- Visualize actual vs predicted prices

This project is ideal for beginners learning **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Financial Analysis**.

## 🚀 Features
- CSV-based stock data processing
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Linear Regression model implementation
- Train-test split without data shuffling
- Performance evaluation using RMSE
- Visualization of prediction results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- yFinance (optional, for live data)
